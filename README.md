# NST Guide Documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nst-guide/docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nst-guide/docs)

This repository holds general documentation about the National Scenic Trails
Guide project. You can find more detailed documentation specifically about the
data generation part of the project [here](https://nst-guide.github.io/data).

I'm currently building this project full-time in between jobs, but I want the
project to move forward into the future as seamlessly as possible. As such, I
want to document as much as possible about what I've learned on this project so
that I can maintain the website and hopefully the mobile app as easily as
possible. Good documentation also increases the likelihood that some developer
out there might be interested in maintaining or contributing to the project.
